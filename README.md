# CPI Health Performance Dashboard

Weekly performance dashboard for CPI Health. Pulls from GA4, Google Ads, and a flat CSV; renders a static HTML dashboard; deploys to GitHub Pages; posts the link to Slack every Monday at 7am CT.

This README is the operating manual. Read top to bottom the first time. After that, the **Run book** section is the only part you'll need most weeks.

## What it does

1. **Pulls** GA4 sessions and conversions for CPI Health and Wellspring Pain Solutions, Google Ads spend and conversions, and the latest `performance_summary.csv` from Drive.
2. **Validates** every data source against a contract — column presence, row counts, date continuity, no negative spend, etc. If any check fails, the pipeline halts and Slack gets a flag.
3. **Transforms** the raw data — normalizes markets (Kentucky, Ohio, Colorado, Texas, Indiana, Minnesota TBD), classifies branded vs. non-branded, joins costs to conversions, attributes new patients to channels proportionally.
4. **Renders** the dashboard HTML (overview, per-market pages, per-channel pages, intersection pages — ~42 pages total).
5. **Publishes** to the `gh-pages` branch, which auto-deploys to GitHub Pages.
6. **Notifies** the team in Slack with the dashboard link and the four topline numbers.

The whole thing runs in GitHub Actions — no server, no manual triggering, no local environment required for the weekly run.

## Run book

### Most weeks (everything works)
Nothing to do. Monday at 7:02am CT you'll see a Slack post in `#cpi-health` with the dashboard link and topline numbers. Click through, eyeball it, move on with your day.

### When the Slack post says "⚠ quality issue flagged"
1. Click the dashboard link anyway — it still renders, just with a banner.
2. Open the methodology page (linked in the dashboard footer) to see which check failed.
3. Common causes and fixes are in [docs/troubleshooting.md](docs/troubleshooting.md).

### When the Slack post says "✕ pipeline failed"
1. Open the Actions tab on GitHub. The failed run shows the error.
2. 90% of the time it's an API credential or a malformed CSV. See [docs/troubleshooting.md](docs/troubleshooting.md).
3. To retry: Actions → "Weekly Refresh" → "Run workflow."

### When you need to refresh manually (off-schedule)
Actions → "Weekly Refresh" → "Run workflow" → "Run workflow." Takes ~2 minutes.

### When a config change is needed
All client-specific behavior lives in `config/dashboard.yml`. Common changes (new metric, new market, threshold tweak) don't require touching code. See [docs/configuration.md](docs/configuration.md).

## First-time setup

You shouldn't need to do this — it's already done. But if you ever clone this for a new client, see [docs/new_client.md](docs/new_client.md).

The short version: install dependencies (`pip install -r requirements.txt`), set up GitHub Actions secrets (GA4 service account JSON, Google Ads developer token + customer ID, Slack webhook URL, Drive service account JSON), then push.

---

## What's deferred to v2

- HubSpot data integration (stub exists)
- BigQuery as the canonical store (currently Google Sheets)
- Date range pickers (currently weekly + monthly fixed grain)
- Campaign-level drilldown pages (slot reserved)
- Email delivery alongside Slack
- Real per-patient source attribution (proportional fallback in place)
